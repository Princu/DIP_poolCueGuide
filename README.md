Pool Cue Guider for an Eight Ball Game
==================================

This project aims at developing an algorithm to determine successful cue ball impact directions to help the player get the best shot possible in a given scenario. From an input picture of a pool table with random cue, taken from a camera fixed on top of the table, i.e table is always in a top-down view in the input image, eight ball, cue ball, solid and striped ball and pocket positions are determined. Using this information, the cue impact vectors can be drawn to guide the cue towards the best possible shot.
Right now, this project has been done upto the step of getting all the information about positions of pockets and balls. Vector and impact physics is still to be done.
